# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
Pyber is a ridesharing app company. Our objective is to to help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

We will be using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplolib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. 

## Preparing the Data
First, we generated a ride-sharing DataFrame by city type using .groupby(), count(), and sum() functions.
